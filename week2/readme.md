## Project Overview

This project is a turn-based battle simulator written in Python.

The player and an enemy take turns attacking until one of them is defeated.  
The game uses loops, lists, and randomness to control game flow and outcomes.

---

## Programs Included

This week includes multiple small practice programs and one main project.

### Mini Assignments

- `countdown.py` – Uses a while loop to count down
- `list_practice.py` – Uses a list and a for loop
- `random_damage.py` – Uses the random module

### Main Assignment

- `battle_simulator.py` – Turn-based battle game

---

## Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the following concepts:

- `while` loops
- `for` loops
- Lists and list indexing
- Iterating over lists
- Random number generation
- Conditional logic
- Basic game loop structure

---

## How to Run the Programs

From inside the `week2` folder, run any file using:

`python filename.py`


Examples:

```python countdown.py
python list_practice.py
python random_damage.py
python battle_simulator.py```

## Battle Simulator Description

Briefly describe how your battle simulator works:

- How does the player attack? 
- How does the enemy attack?
- What determines a win or loss?
- Are there any player choices?

(Write 4–6 sentences.)
# Both the player and enemy attack with sheer energy. Due to that, theres a chance for 500 damage to be dealt should one accidently "let go" of control. The current win or lose is if either one the villain or hero HP reach 0. I decided to omit having to right any player choices. The code is clean in my opinion but Im still learning and overload myself in thinking of such a possibility and just burn myself out before any work is even started.

## Design Decisions

Describe any design choices you made:

- Why did you use lists the way you did? 
- How did you structure your loop?
- Did you add anything optional or extra?

(2–4 sentences.)
# I just used it as simple as is as to not again overload myself with the different ways it can be used. Just a simple call back to choose what "damage" the hero or villain to do. I made it so the villain attacked first, since really, when will a good guy get the first shot off? And I didnt add any extra other than maybe the 500 damage option in the list to potentially end the fight outright.

## Known Issues or Limitations

List any bugs, missing features, or improvements you would make with more time.

If none, write:  
`None`
None

## Reflection

Answer the following questions:

- What concept from this week was the most challenging?
- What concept do you feel most confident about?
- What part of your code are you most proud of?

(3–5 sentences total.)
# The most challenging part of all this was for sure was properly finding which module to use to begin the script. Honestly before you came I was scouring the module page beforehand to figureo ut what to do. I do feel a lot more confident into lists. I feel I likely can do even better in tuples and dictionaries. I feel super proud of the "random.choice" after I finally had found it was literally the best and perfect fit random module to choose out of the others I read from.
