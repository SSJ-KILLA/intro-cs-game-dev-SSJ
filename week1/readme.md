Project Overview
This project is a simple text-based adventure game written in Python.

The goal of the game is to make choices that lead the player to either a win or a loss.
The game uses variables, conditionals, and functions to control game flow and outcomes.

How the Game Works
The player is presented with a scenario.
The player makes choices using text input.
The program uses conditional logic to determine what happens next.
The game ends in either a win or a loss.

Concepts Used
This project demonstrates the following concepts:

Variables and data types
User input using input()
Output using print()
Conditional logic (if, elif, else)
Functions to organize code

Design Notes
Briefly describe your game:

What is the setting? The setting is in a spacial void. Where all things are concepted before becoming "something."
What choices does the player make? The choices the player makes are in relevance to the creation of a "vessel."
What determines a win or loss? Nothing does, as all there is is just the creation of basically a body.

(Write 3–5 sentences.)

Reflection
Answer the following:

What part of this project was the most challenging? Figuring out how to create options. I thought I had forgotton the option to create a type of "message script" to create options for the player to choose from. When in reality, all I had to do was just make those options in a string alone while creating a variable with value to compare for the options alone.

What concept do you feel most confident about after completing this? I feel most confident in assingning and using variables. They help with joining together and furthering more connections. I Also feel more confident in F-Strings as its nice to able to call upon a specific string thats too far to matter scrolling to or making a whole new line of script for a simple function.

(2–4 sentences total.)
