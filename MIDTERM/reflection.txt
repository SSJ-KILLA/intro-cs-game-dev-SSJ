What was the hardest part of this midterm and why?

The hardest part of this midterm was building the combat system in a way that always ended cleanly without crashing or getting stuck in a loop, especially when handling invalid input from the player.
Making sure HP values updated correctly across multiple turns and rooms required careful testing and logic checks.
Another challenge was organizing the code across multiple files and making sure everything imported and worked together properly.


What is one thing you would refactor if you had another day?

If I had another day, I would refactor the combat system to reduce repeated logic and make enemy behavior more flexible, possibly by creating a shared function for damage calculation.
This would make the code easier to read and expand later.

What concept from Weeks 1–5 did you improve the most?

The concept I improved the most from Weeks 1–5 was program structure and control flow, particularly using loops, dictionaries, and functions together to manage game state.
I also became more confident using try/except to handle invalid input safely without breaking the program.
