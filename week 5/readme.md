# Week 5 – Game Design Fundamentals

This folder contains all assignments for Week 5, which focuses on game design concepts rather than coding.

## Files Included

- `core_loop_analysis.txt`  
  Analysis of the core gameplay loop from an existing game.

- `player_actions.txt`  
  A list of possible player actions (verbs) for a future game idea.

- `game_design.md`  
  A mini game design document outlining a small, scoped game concept.

## Purpose

The goal of this week is to practice thinking like a game designer by:
- Identifying core gameplay loops
- Defining player actions
- Establishing clear win and loss conditions
- Controlling scope before writing code
