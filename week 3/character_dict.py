# So first thing is we're making a characters info card. Their name, health, and their damage.

PlayerA = {
    "name": "The Volatile",
    "health": 250,
    "attack": 12.5
}
# MAKE SURE YOU PUT THE COMMA, IT WONT BE CONSIDERED CLOSED IF YOU DONT. 

# Now to make sure its working right, we check with the print command'
print(PlayerA)

# And lets go ahead and just get a modify for it here as well. We're just gonna clear it and print the result.

PlayerA.clear()
print(PlayerA)
