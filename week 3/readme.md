## Project Overview

This project is a small RPG-style game written in Python.

The game uses dictionaries to store player and enemy data and splits logic across multiple Python files to improve structure and readability.

---

## Programs Included

This week includes two practice programs and one main project.

### Mini Assignments

- `character_dict.py` – Character data stored in a dictionary
- `inventory.py` – Inventory system using a dictionary

### Main Assignment

- `main.py` – Main game loop
- `characters.py` – Player and enemy creation and logic

---

## Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the following concepts:

- Dictionaries (`dict`)
- Accessing and modifying dictionary values
- Passing dictionaries into functions
- Organizing code across multiple files
- Importing functions from other Python files
- Cleaner program structure

---

## How to Run the Programs

From inside the `week3` folder, run:

`python main.py`

Make sure all `.py` files are in the same folder so imports work correctly.

---

## RPG Game Description

Describe how your RPG-lite game works:

- How is the player represented using a dictionary?
- How are enemies represented?
- How does combat work?
- What determines a win or loss?

(Write 4–6 sentences.)

---

## File Structure Explanation

Briefly explain what each file is responsible for:

- `main.py`  
- `characters.py`  
- `character_dict.py`  
- `inventory.py`  

(1–2 sentences per file.)

---

## Design Decisions

Describe any design decisions you made:

- Why did you use dictionaries instead of lists or variables?
- How did splitting code into multiple files help?
- Did you reuse logic from Week 2?

(3–5 sentences.)

---

## Known Issues or Limitations

List any bugs, missing features, or improvements you would make with more time.

If none, write:  
`None`

---

## Reflection

Answer the following:

- What was the hardest concept this week?
- What part of your program structure are you most confident in?
- How did using multiple files change how you think about writing programs?

(4–6 sentences total.)
